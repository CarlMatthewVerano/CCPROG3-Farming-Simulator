# CCPROG3-Farming-Simulator
Group members: Frances Dela Cruz, Carl Matthew Verano

In partial fulfillment to the course CCPROG3, the group implemented a farming simulator app while strictly following the MVC framework, while also including all OOP concepts (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, etc.). The application can be run by running the driver class. Users can plow tiles, shovel (removes) seeds/plants, mines (through the use of a pickaxe) rocks, water crops, and plant seeds. The game ends when player runs out of coins (by purchasing/using some seeds/tools).
