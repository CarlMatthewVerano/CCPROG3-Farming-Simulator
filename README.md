# CCPROG3-Farming-Simulator
Group members: Frances Dela Cruz, Carl Matthew Verano

In partial fulfillment of the course CCPROG3, the group implemented a farming simulator app while strictly following the MVC framework and also including all OOP concepts (inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, etc.). The application is essentially a farming simulator board game that can be run by running the driver class. Users can plow tiles to be able to plant seeds, water them, shovel (remove) seeds, crops, or withered crops. There are randomized rock placements on the board, where players cannot plant seeds on the tiles with rocks or when surrounded by them. The game ends when a player runs out of coins (by purchasing/using some seeds/tools). Players can move on to the next in-game day when they are done with their actions in the current day they're in.
